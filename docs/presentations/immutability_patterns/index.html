# How to compare objects?
*Reference Equality* and *Value Equality*

    var x = 12,
        y = 12;

    var object = { x: 1, y: 2 };
    var object2 = { x: 1, y: 2 };
    object === object2 // false

* `object` and `object2` are the same in terms of values
* but they are not the same in terms of reference

If you think about equality of things, you can in fact think about two things:
*does a thing mean the same as the other thing?*
*is a thing exactly the same thing as the other thing?*

-----
# Continued...

When you compare objects in JavaScript, they are compared by a reference. That means
the equality check like this:

    object === object2

Answers the question: Is `object` the same object as `object2`? In fact, when you assign
an object to variable x, you assign a reference of an object to variable x.

    object = object2;
    object === object2; // true

-----
# Continued...
This has some interesting consequences.

    object.x = 12;
    object.x; // 12
    object2.x; // 12

In this case, you did assign x key of an object `object`. But since `object` and `object2` points to the same reference, the change is visible through both variables.

Every complex data structure in JavaScript follows the principles of reference equality. This includes arrays and objects. In fact, arrays are objects too:

    typeof([1,2,3]) // "object"
-----
# Value Equality
Value equality answers the question: Does a thing means the same as the other thing?

    var object = { x: 1, y: 2 };
    var object2 = { x: 1, y: 2 };
    valueEqual(object, object2) === true

Implementing such equality would be harder with nested data structures. Objects can have arbitrary keys and values.
It can contain other objects within them. To make such equality for objects, you’d need to follow the following algorithm:

-----
# Continued...
    // Input: an object1 and object2
    // Output:
        true if an object1 is equal in terms of values to object2
    valueEqual(object1, object2):
      object1keys = &lt;list of keys of object1&gt;
      object2keys = &lt;list of keys of object2&gt;
      return false if length(object1keys) != length(object2keys)

      for each key in object1keys:
        return false if key not in object2keys
        return false if typeof(object1[key]) != typeof(object2[key])
        if object1[key] is an object:
          keyEqual = valueEqual(object1[key], object2[key])
          return false if keyEqual != false
        if object1[key] is a primitive:
          return false if object1[key] != object2[key]
      return true

For deeply nested structures, it can make hundreds of equality checks to compare two objects.
Such equality checks are commonly called [deep equality checks](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/blob/master/.internal/baseIsEqualDeep.js).
-----
# Get rid of mutations
*Whenever your object would be mutated, don’t do it. Instead, create a changed copy of it*

You can use:

* Object.assign({}, ...)
* [].concat
* ... operator
* External libraries (Immutable.js, Icepick, etc)

-----

# Not using an external library?

* Pros
  * Seemless interoperability with JavaScript
  * Suitable for small and simple JavaScript objects
  * Easy to debug
* Cons
  * Performance issues for big datasets
  * Tedious and harder to read code when doing nested updates
  * Accidental direct mutations

-----

# Using Immutable.js?

* Cons
  * Difficult to interoperate with. For example, instead of `myObj.prop1.prop2.prop3`, you would use `ImmutableMap.getIn([‘prop1’, ‘prop2’, ‘prop3’])`
  * Can spread throughout the codebase, as the codebase must know what is, and what is not, an Immutable.JS object
  * Difficult to debug
  * No Destructuring or Spread Operators
  * Not suitable for small values that change often

-----
# Continued...

* Pros
  * [Persistent data structures and structural sharing](https://medium.com/@dtinth/immutable-js-persistent-data-structures-and-structural-sharing-6d163fbd73d2)
  * Optimized for large datasets and objects
  * Mitigates accidental mutations
  * Works great if some [opinionated best practices are followed](https://redux.js.org/docs/recipes/UsingImmutableJS.html#what-are-some-opinionated-best-practices-for-using-immutablejs-with-redux)

-----
# Immutability and React.js

  * When state changes, component re-renders. React can’t assume anything about your state. That’s why setting state
  always re-renders the component - even if it’s not necessary at all, as React [doesn't deeply compare props/state by default](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/01/08/A-implies-B-does-not-imply-B-implies-A.html)
  * For a complicated state (nested objects), you'd be forced to make a deep equality check,
  because when objects are compared using reference equality you can’t be sure whether the next state is changed. *So
  if you want to optimize React to perform updates only when necessary, you would need to make hundreds of value equality checks if your state is huge*

-----
# shouldComponentUpdate?

It is a lifecycle optimization method which allows your Component to exit the Update life cycle if there is no reason to apply a new render

* Out of the box, the shouldComponentUpdate() is a no-op that returns true
* Implementation for Pure React components

        function shallowEqual(objA: mixed, objB: mixed): boolean {....}

        function shallowCompare(instance, nextProps, nextState) {
          return (!shallowEqual(instance.props, nextProps) || !shallowEqual(instance.state, nextState));
        }

        shouldComponentUpdate: function(nextProps, nextState) {
          return shallowCompare(this, nextProps, nextState);
        }

-----
# Continued...

`shallowCompare` uses `===` to compare objects. If current state is mutated for a Pure Component, it will return `true` resulting in no re-render.

This is why [Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/ThreePrinciples.html#changes-are-made-with-pure-functions) requires pure methods for reducers. If you need to change nested data you have to clone the objects and make sure a new instance is always returned.
This allows for shallowCompare() to see the change and update the component.

Usage of **Immutable.js** enforces immutability. We can leverage `shouldComponentUpdate()` and have it verify that props and state have changed.


-----
# As per Redux docs

The process of correctly applying immutable updates to deeply nested state can easily become verbose and hard to read.
Here's what an example of updating `state.first.second[someId].fourth` might look like:

        function updateVeryNestedField(state, action) {
            return {
                ...state,
                first : {
                    ...state.first,
                    second : {
                        ...state.first.second,
                        [action.someId] : {
                            ...state.first.second[action.someId],
                            fourth : action.someValue
                        }
                    }}}}

-----
# A nice API please

**Note**: Interoperable with JavaScript

      import { setIn } from "somewhere"

      function updateVeryNestedField(state, action) {
        const newState = setIn(state, `first.second[${action.someId}].fourth`, action.someValue)
        console.log(state === newState) // false
        return newState
      }

      import { deleteIn } from "somewhere"

      function deleteVeryNestedField(state, action) {
        const newState = deleteIn(state, `first.second[${action.someId}].fourth`)
        console.log(state === newState) // false
        return newState
      }
